# Genetic Algorithms and Mathematical Equalities

A demonstration of genetic algorithms to find the variables to solve a mathematical equality. Made for my Artificial Intelligence course.

To run the program:
1.	Download and install Eclipse Neon. https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ with Java 8.
2.	Open Eclipse, create new `Java Project`.
3.	Right-click the `src` folder of the new project in the package explorer. Select `New Package`. Name it `projectsrc.projectsrc`. Click Finish.
4.	Right-click the new `projectsrc.projectsrc` package in the package explorer, click `Import`. Expand `General` folder, select `File System` and select `Next`. Next to `From directory` text box, click `Browse`, and select the folder containing the source code. Check/enable the root-level directory on the left-side (to get all subfolders and files). Click `Finish`.
5.	Right click the project in the package explorer. Expand `Build Path` and click `Configure Build Path…`. Expand `JRE System Library [JavaSE-1.8]`, select `Access rules: No rules defined` and click the `Edit…` button. Click `Add…`, change the `Resolution` dropdown to `Accessible`, and enter `javafx/**` into the rule pattern. Click `OK`.
6.	Open the `ProjectMain.java` file and click the `Run` button at the top.

Please note that when running the algorithm, if a solution is found, the solution is printed in the console.
